1- Prerequisites (define the EUs and the skills essential to follow the EU concerned)
1- Maintenance
2- Transmission technique
3- Telecommunications initiation
4- Probabilities
 
2- Objectives of the EU (use Bloom's taxonomy or other recognized reference, the
objectives can be specified here or at the level of each ECUE, they must be
compliant)
1. Define the tools and methods of Operational Safety used in
industry for the assurance of equipment availability. Highlight the
tools for qualitative and quantitative analysis of failures and to evaluate via laws
probability with different parameters related to the SdF: reliability, MTBF, MTTR,
availability
2. Understand attack techniques and exploitation of vulnerabilities
protocols to carry out intrusions. Apply the mechanisms and protocols
security at the SE level. Recognizing the risk following a security incident
in an embedded system.
3. analyze random phenomena using stochastic models.
