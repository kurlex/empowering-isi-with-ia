1- Objectives of the Diagnostic phase
 
The diagnostic phase or initial audit is the first step in a project to set up a
management system for education/training organizations (SMOE) according to the Standard
ISO 21001:2018
The objectives of this step are to:
• A good understanding of how the organization operates and verify the
compliance of the existing with the requirements of the ISO21001 standard;
• Establish a preliminary version of the organization's process map
adapted to the needs and expectations and to the strategy of the management of the ISI establishment;
• Estimate the durations and fields of intervention of the expert team during the phase
accompanying
Familiarize yourself with the organization (staff, premises, environment, procedures, etc.)
 
2- Scope of application of the ISO 21001:2018 Standard
 
ISO 21001 Standard specifies requirements for a Management System for
Education/training organizations (SMOE) when such an organization:  
(a) must demonstrate his or her ability to promote the acquisition and development of
skills through education, training, apprenticeship or
research ;  
(b) aims to increase the satisfaction of learners, other beneficiaries and the
staff through the effective application of its SMOE, including processes for
system improvement and assurance of compliance with the requirements of
learners and other beneficiaries.  
 
It should be noted that all the requirements of the ISO 21001:2018 standard are generic and
intended to apply to any organization that uses a curriculum to promote the
skills development through education, training, apprenticeship
or research, regardless of its type, size or delivery methods
.

Specific synthetic evaluations
➢ Assessment of staff skills
The people encountered benefit from the essential skills for the proper execution of tasks
requested and the motivation necessary for the success of this project.
However, work is needed to:
- Document knowledge management and skills development;
- Provide training on strategic orientations and requirements of the ISO standard
21001:2018;
- Provide training on the requirements of the ISO 31000:2018 standard;
- Establish a functional organization chart (define roles and responsibilities within
the establishment) as well as the job descriptions;
- Improve the recruitment arrangements for temporary workers.
➢ Evaluation of available material and immaterial resources
It is important, during the implementation of the SMOE, to focus on optimizing the operation
equipment and materials necessary for the provision of educational services by clearly defining
and overall acquisition needs, by implementing preventive maintenance planning
which will guarantee the availability and quality of operation of these resources.
It is also important to raise a structural problem at the level of the premises and infrastructure of the institute.
computer science major.
A lack of staff is reported (e.g. no drivers at the establishment, only one person
takes care of finance and purchasing, lab technicians, etc.)
➢ Evaluation of the activity of the departments
During the diagnostic audit, recommendations were raised:
- The course plans are already established. However, a course progress sheet exists at
ASR department level (system and network architecture), but it is not generalized by
all departments;
- Pedagogical and didactic training for teachers is not planned;
- The summative grading and assessment system is not followed at the level of the activities of the
departments;
- Low involvement of department directors during the conduct of examinations, otherwise it is
recommended to appoint an examination committee.
➢ Objectives identified during the ISI diagnosis
- The management's objective is to adapt to the new learning mode, and improve the
support for learners and the educational environment and above all its commitment to
two quality support projects;
- The objectives at the PAQ cell level concern the certification of the organization, the reform
pedagogical training, the sustainability of the management culture of education;
- The objectives of the management of studies concern the accreditation of the three engineering courses, the
success of the reform and the systematization of the accreditation of courses;
- The objective of the development of the staff and stakeholders of the organization;
- The objective and digitalization of the internship and PFE process, and the Internship platform as well as the
development of socio-economic partnerships and teacher certification;

- The objective of perpetuating certification achievements and continuing training for teachers
so that he becomes more involved in teaching;
- The objective of student well-being, the organization of educational affairs;
- Encourage co-graduation, entrepreneurship and incubators.
➢ Identification of the resources needed to successfully and successfully complete the mission of setting up a
SMOE
Management must define the roles of the actors and assign the responsibilities of each of them in the SMOE.
The designation of a manager to ensure the proper functioning of the SMOE and the smooth running of
different stages of the project, particularly with regard to monitoring the actions proposed by the consultants
experts and accepted by the ISI management, is of crucial importance for the success of the project and the
sustainability of the SMOE
It is also important to raise the structural problem of the premises' infrastructure (emergency exit, controls
legal and technical requirements of installations, etc.), lack of material resources and equipment.
➢ Evaluation of the activities of the studies department
During the diagnosis of the management of studies, the following observations were made:
- Mastery of curriculum design is not demonstrated,
- Lack of inventory of teaching and learning materials at the level of the management of studies;
- Mastery of the design and development of the educational service at the level of definition of
objectives of the courses, curricula and lessons are established. However, this mastery is neither
neither traced nor defined at the level of the management of studies;
- The job description of the director of studies should be formalized;
- Student absences are not monitored despite the presence of a requirement
regulatory especially for the training of engineers;
- Monitoring of the progress of training in accordance with the program is not ensured by the
department or by the management of studies;
- The evaluation of undergraduate training through student surveys has raised
some failures and have generated recommendations. However, this investigation is not
generalized for all courses.
➢ Weak points were raised at the administration level:
- The deployment of staff at the examination and education level is not well formalized, highlighting
question the fairness of the distribution of staff workload;
- The education service does not ensure adequate monitoring of students' needs given the lack of
adequate training;
- The absenteeism rate is high at the staff level and is not monitored;
- The library is managed by a single person;
- Purchasing management is provided by the finance department.
➢ Assessment of the overall state of conformity with the requirements of the ISO 21001:2018 standard
Average compliance rates are calculated in relation to the satisfaction of the requirements requested at the level
chapters of the ISO 21001:2018 standard.

The assessment of the overall state of conformity of the application of the SMOE requirements is certainly not a
evaluation of the organization or its personnel, nor an evaluation of the quality of the services provided
the body.
The assessment of the overall state of conformity of the application of the SMOE requirements is a tool that allows
experts to judge the feasibility of setting up an EMS and to estimate the number of
days required for a support mission.
For the organization, the assessment of the overall state of conformity of the application of the SMOE requirements is a
tool that allows you to estimate the efforts that need to be deployed to set up an EMS.
Since there are no international statistics on the subject, the feedback from the office's experts allows
estimate that an organization having more than 20% as an overall satisfaction rate (internal statistic at
office), is a well-functioning organization with good strategy, good organization and good
level of competence of its staff but which requires better organization and formalization of
provisions.

General Conclusion
The overall investigations of the initial audit mission of the current ISI system demonstrate:
• A spirit of leadership;
• An excellent level of maturity in the control of operational activities;
• Operational arrangements are moderately formalized;
• Competent, generally versatile staff;
• A team spirit and synergy that promotes continuous improvement of the system;
• The institute emphasizes student development: The importance given to learners in
level of training courses, integration of clubs (11 clubs), definition of the systematic orientation of the
customer satisfaction, lack of equipment, extra activities, participation in the scientific council,
taking into account the needs of students, monitoring alumni.
However, it is important to:
• Integrate the requirements of the SMOE according to the ISO 21001:2018 standard into the operational activities of
the organization;
• It is important to create a process for developing the strategic direction of
the long-term establishment;
• Develop a process approach integrating activities related to human resources management,
provision of resources, infrastructure management, skills development
(training), budget management etc.
