Teaching Unit: Modeling, identification and control of systems
ECUE no 1.1: MP identification and digital control of systems
Constituent Element Plan (ECUE)
Prerequisites:
 
1- Continuous and sampled automatic  
2- Microcontrollers
3- Arduino cards
 
 
Constituent Element Learning Objectives (CELU):
 
At the end of the component, the student will be able to:
OE1: Apply real-time control techniques for dynamic systems such as
than mobile robots, thermal enclosures and DC motors
OE2: Implement control laws on Arduino boards for control

Description of the content of the constituent element
 
I. Control of a mobile robot to follow a path in advance using sensors
infrared.
 
II. Control of a mobile obstacle-avoiding robot in a hostile environment through
sensors
ultrasound.
The hardware used for controlling the line-following and/or obstacle-avoiding mobile robot
East :
1. Two-wheeled mobile robot
2. Infrared sensors
3. Ultrasonic sensors
4. Arduino board
5. Integrated circuit (LM398) for driving the wheels of the mobile robot
 
III. Acquisition of data from a temperature sensor of a thermal enclosure at
across the
Arduino cards and real-time display of this data whether on 7" displays
segments or directly on PC. Possibly, it is a question of implementing a PID command
via the Arduino board.
The equipment used for acquiring data from the thermal enclosure is:
1. Thermal enclosure equipped with a halogen lamp
2. Arduino board
3. Temperature sensor
4. 7-segment display compatible with Arduino board
5. PC
 
IV. Design and implementation of a range of PI and PID control approaches for the
speed control of a direct current motor (DCM) equipped with an incremental encoder, and
this via Arduino cards.
