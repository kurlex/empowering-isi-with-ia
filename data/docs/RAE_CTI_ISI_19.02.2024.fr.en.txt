TO THE INSTITUTE AND ITS GOVERNANCE   
A.1 Identity and autonomy  
The Higher Institute of Computer Science (ISI), under the supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education and
of scientific research, attached to the University of Tunis El Manar (UTM), was created under the
Decree No. 1912 dated August 14, 2001 (Annex A.1) in response to the UTM initiative aimed at
establish a digital hub within the university. Orientation law n° 19 -2008 on
higher education (Annex A.2) gives the ISI the status of a Public Establishment of a
Administrative (EPA) which enjoys legal personality. The institute is thus governed by the code of the
public accounting and by the regulation of public markets according to decree No. 2014-1039 of
March 13, 2014 (Appendix A.3). The ISI benefits from a strategic location in the center of Ariana,
proximity to three major industrial sites in the Greater Tunis region, home to several of our
key partners.
The training courses offered by ISI are specifically focused on the field of IT and its
various applications. As the only and youngest specialized IT institution in the world,
Within the university, the ISI has established itself as one of the most sought-after institutions for its
post-baccalaureate training and access to its engineering training. As a result, it arouses the interest of
best students.
The ISI is subject to prior control by the public expenditure controller and benefits from a
partial financial autonomy. The ISI budget is attached by order to the State budget
including the operating budget, known as Title I, and the budget for carrying out projects and
the acquisition of scientific equipment, known as Title II. In addition to these funds allocated by the Ministry, the ISI has  
always worked to diversify its resources in order to strengthen its financial autonomy thanks to
multiple national and international projects and funds linked to continuing education and
recruitment of foreign students.
Permanent teaching and administrative staff whose salaries are financed from the state budget
is recruited by national juries according to the positions and specialties required by the ISI after validation
of the scientific council and approval of the University.  
Part-time teachers, visiting professors or experts from the socio-economic sector are
financially managed by the ISI and chosen by the director of the department in consultation with the
colleagues in the relevant specialty. The establishment also benefits from total autonomy in
level of management of its buildings, heritage and vehicle fleet. The ISI adapts its premises
in accordance with its vision and objectives, modifying their configuration with a view to
optimization.
The ISI has committed to a quality assurance process. In this context, the establishment is
to be certified soon according to the ISO 21001 standard. This approach contributes to the improvement of its
management capacities with a view to transforming its status as a public establishment with a
administrative (EPA) with the status of a Public Scientific and Technological Establishment
(EPST). This status allows the ISI total financial autonomy and the improvement of its operating method
governance. A file to this effect is currently being prepared.
The ISI has a deliberative scientific council, which constitutes the principal strategic body of
the establishment. It submits to the hierarchy proposals relating to the creation, suppression or
change of training. The scientific council retains its decision-making rights for
accreditation of diplomas.

of society and provide values ​​such as sustainability, ethics and social responsibility.
In addition, the ISI is a breeding ground for clubs and associations. Cultural, scientific and
sports events are continually organized to promote integration and celebrate diversity
cultural and social within the educational community. This involves taking into account the
different origins, traditions, languages ​​and experiences of the individuals who make up this
community. The ISI also offers open days for high school students and
middle school students, while also organizing thematic days in collaboration with
industrial. These events aim to present the latest technological advances and to promote
collaborations with socially engaged partners. ISI also supports the
staff development by providing opportunities for professional improvement,
in particular by ensuring continuing training and the acquisition of skills. Certification
ISI's SMOE ISO 21001 certification, scheduled for 2024, will strengthen this commitment. In addition, the institution creates
a work environment that is conducive to employee engagement, participation and well-being.
Preserving the physical and mental health of staff and students remains a priority
major, materializing by the provision of an infirmary and a psychology service.
In addition, for the last two years, a breast cancer screening day has been organized in
support for the Pink October initiative.
On the environmental side, the ISI encourages ecological initiatives focused on the economy
energy by putting up posters in the hallways to raise awareness among students to adopt
eco-responsible behaviors. Efforts are also being made to add greenery to
common areas. In addition, the digitalization process implemented at ISI aims to simplify
not only remote teaching and working, but also to reduce the use of paper and
printers.
A.2.2 Site Policy  
The ISI occupies a strategic position in the centre of the city of Ariana, north of the capital. It is
easily accessible thanks to excellent public transport links such as buses and

The main goal of communication is to enable smooth exchange and coordination
effective between stakeholders. With this in mind, the new web portal, currently being implemented
place, includes an intranet space allowing access to the various administrative structures,
available and attentive to the needs of the various stakeholders. Communication with the
students is also ensured by meetings and assemblies, mailing lists by
 
 
8
 
institutional e-mail, displays, on the official website and the official page
ISI on Facebook. Delegates, elected annually by students, also play a role
as an intermediary between the administration and their comrades. In addition, an integration day is
organized at the start of each university year, including stands presenting activities
associative clubs and guided tours of the premises, offering new students more details
on their academic journey.
The ISI has implemented an external communication strategy aimed at increasing its visibility both
at both national and international level. Particular attention has been paid to the modernization of the
website of the institute, currently being redesigned. News is regularly broadcast through

A.4 Missions of the ISI
A.4.1 ISI training offer
The development of training programs is carried out collaboratively between the ISI, represented
through its departments, the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, as well
than the professional sector. This collaboration results from a comparative study (benchmarking)
at the national and international level. The ministry is involved in the validation process of
path, thus ensuring coherence between the proposed national strategic visions and the
implementation of training.  
In response to the needs of the professional world and society, the ISI has developed a global strategy
for a diversified offer of qualifying training courses, aligned in a coherent manner and
complementary to all of the establishment's courses. These courses include
qualifying and certifying training courses, two of which are international, thus meeting the requirements
updating and developing the skills of engineers and managers in their roles.
Thus, the ISI offers a range of training courses that are part of its current strategy. This offer
includes three engineering degrees, a professional master's degree, a research master's degree and four
professional masters in distance learning including two international masters in partnership
with the University Agency of the Francophonie (AUF).
For high school graduates, the ISI offers three courses covering three areas: software engineering, networking
and cybersecurity as well as embedded systems and the Internet of Things.
Regarding the engineering course, the ISI offers three specializations lasting three years. Admission
These courses are accessed through a specific national competition, 40% of which are graduates of
the institute. After a common core of three semesters, three specialties are available covering the
same areas mentioned above.
To welcome master's students, the ISI has opted for complementary training with the
degree courses thus promoting the capitalization of resources and the diversity of audiences in
a goal of sharing and consolidating partnerships in the field. Thus, the masters
professionals target the upskilling of professionals, while masters in
research aims to broaden the horizons of students wishing to pursue a career in
scientific research in computer science. Two masters are thus available: the first, in
collaboration with the Chamber of Commerce, is a professional master's degree in Computer Science in
Information Systems and Infrastructure Security (SSII). The second is a master's degree in
 
 
10
 
research in computer science with two distinct paths: Intelligent Systems in Imaging and Vision
Artificial Intelligence (SIIVA) and Software Engineering (GL). At the same time, the training offer includes four
masters courses, in distance learning (FAD), co-managed in collaboration with the Center
National Continuing Education and Professional Promotion (CNFCPP) and the Virtual University
of Tunis (UVT). These masters are part of the continuing education policy intended for
professionals in the sector, in order to enable them to consolidate their skills and progress in
their careers. Indeed, the ISI offers in particular a professional master's degree in Computer Science in
Free Software (MP2L), in partnership with UVT. For two years, three Professional Masters in
collaboration with the CNFCPP, focused on cutting-edge, complementary and highly relevant themes
requested, are also available: Security of Information Systems and Infrastructures
(SSII), Software Engineering (MDL), and Intelligent Systems and IoT (SIIOT). These training courses are very
appreciated within the professional community of the field and were designed in response to the
needs expressed by the CNFCPP. Since January 2024, the MDL and SSII masters have carried the mention
"international master", thus promoting the expansion of the ISI network and its opening to a new
international audience targeting foreign students across the world.
The management of the various ISI training courses is ensured by a four-part structure
departments and masters committees according to their respective specialties. In order to ensure monitoring
effective teaching and continuous improvement of training, teaching teams are
established within all departments (Appendix A.10). Table A-1 summarizes the staff numbers

A.4.2 Research policy
ISI is committed to ensuring an effective connection between engineering training and research,
thus promoting the transfer of scientific knowledge through applied research as well
as well as active participation in research governance, both at national and international levels.
Thanks to its diverse community, the ISI benefits from committed and active skills in a wide
range of disciplines focused on innovation and emerging technologies. Teachers-
researchers (ECs) of the ISI, belonging to the various research structures and exploring different
current research areas, actively contribute to the development of research at ISI.
In fact, 92% of teachers, all grades combined, join research structures in Tunisia,
45% of which are under the supervision of the UTM. Their average scientific production amounts to more than ten-
eight (18) publications and fifty (50) communications per year (Annex A.11). As an illustration, in
2023, ten (10) assistant professors have successfully completed their university accreditation. In order to promote
further increase national and international influence, as well as strengthen the sharing of
knowledge and skills, 30% of ISI ECs are involved in the organization of
scientific events such as national conferences, seminars, workshops and
international conferences. Among them, thirteen (13) ECs hold responsibilities within
research laboratories (one director of the LIMTIC laboratory of the ISI), and five (05) as heads
team in laboratories at ENIT, FST, ENSI, EPT and ISG.  
The ISI houses the Computer Science, Modeling and Information Processing Research Laboratory and
of Knowledge (LIMTIC), established in 2016. Its membership extends to fundamental research
and applied playing an essential role in improving training in a field in
 
 
11
 
perpetual evolution. Currently, LIMTIC has approximately eighty (80) researchers, including  
twenty (20) permanent teacher-researchers and sixty (60) student-researchers. This
research structure plays an essential role in consolidating the scientific activities of
ISI teachers, thus strengthening the existing research master's training in Computer Science
with the two previously mentioned courses GL and SIIVA. LIMTIC members are already strongly
involved in teaching this master's degree and in supervising students during the
preparation of their engineering dissertations, master's degrees and theses. In short, this structure of
research has consolidated the scientific activities of ISI teachers, thus creating a pole
of excellence in scientific research within the establishment.
The ISI thus mobilizes support systems, intended for the development of projects, for the pursuit
doctoral studies and certain teaching discharges to enable ECs to
to get involved effectively in these projects. Part of the budget rented to the institute is also
dedicated to financing the participation of ECs in scientific events within the
country and abroad.  
Convinced of the importance of research to improve the effectiveness of teaching practices
and ensure the employability of graduate engineers, the ISI promotes transdisciplinary research.
In fact, the establishment has launched strategic initiatives to weave a network of collaboration between
companies and universities in innovation, as well as the application of R&D. The involvement of
students and ECs is encouraged through regular events (ISI Research Day, ISI
Companies, days of scientific meetings focused on their areas of expertise).  
Furthermore, the ISI library is a pillar in strengthening scientific research.
Thus, the ISI management regularly consults its teachers to identify their needs.
specific, thus ensuring targeted acquisition of works. In addition, electronic resources
provided by the CNUDST are made available to teachers, allowing access to databases
of internationally renowned bibliographic data.  
A.5 Means and their use  
A.5.1 Human resources  
Faced with the rapid evolution of new technologies, the ISI remains committed to supporting the
professional development of its teaching staff, thus ensuring the continued relevance of its
study programs. The ISI teaching team is made up of 1,63 teachers, including 26
currently on secondment to the ATCT. These teachers are spread across the four
departments of the institute, including 10 6 teacher-researchers, 2 3 core professors
common, 9 experts from the socio-economic world, 7 contract assistants as well as 18
temporary researchers. Language teaching (French and English) is provided by
secondary school teachers assigned to the ISI. The management of teaching loads is
carried out by the departments, relying on the teaching units according to the
teacher skills, in accordance with Decree No. 2000-240 of January 31, 2000. The ISI has
also nearly forty administrative staff, technicians and permanent workers in
activity to ensure the proper functioning of the various administrative services detailed in
the ISI organization chart. Technicians also ensure the maintenance of the IT equipment
practical work rooms and ensuring the proper functioning of the laboratories (Appendix A.12).
 
 
12
 
A.5.2 Premises and material resources
The ISI has an infrastructure comprising mainly teaching rooms, a
amphitheater, practical work laboratories, a meeting room, a 4C center, a room
reading, a research laboratory, a sociocultural room, a thesis room, a health unit,
a shop, a refreshment bar, offices for teachers, and administrative offices (Annex
A.13).  
For all practical work rooms, the ISI is equipped with functional materials meeting the
needs, specific laboratories dedicated to teaching electronics, networks and
telecommunications, thus providing students with additional practical training
theoretical teaching. The renewal of teaching materials is carried out through
multiple channels:
- Competitive funding awarded by the Ministry of Higher Education and
Scientific Research (Quality Support Programs);
- European projects (Erasmus, Tempus, etc.);
- International Cooperation Fund;
- “Title II” budget of the ministry.
In addition, with the financial support of the PAQ and 4C projects, the ISI is preparing the establishment of a space
FABLAB and the development of some premises for clubs.   
The ISI coordinates the purchase of IT equipment through contracts grouped by the university, a
approach which restricts the flexibility of the establishment in the choice of computer equipment
tailored to their specific needs. In addition, the acquisition of educational software is based on the needs
expressed by the various departments. A constant effort is made to ensure a
optimal Internet connection and extend the Wi-Fi network to the entire establishment. The ISI is
connected to the external network by a fiber optic WAN link and benefits from a flow rate of 80
Mbps. The facility's network, including cabling and routers, has recently been upgraded.
Network administration is entrusted to a technician responsible for managing the various
ISI LAN components, LAN and connection troubleshooting
Internet and the proposal of new solutions aimed at improving the quality of the network in
the establishment.
A.5.3 Information systems and digital resources
The ISI is committed to a process of modernizing its training offering by implementing
IT resources, in particular through an IT portal to centralize everything
of its services. To strengthen the regulation of the use of IT resources and
digital, the ISI, represented by the CS, recently adopted a Responsible Digital charter  
(Annex A.14).
Connected to the National University Network, the ISI can thus interact with other establishments
academics and access the Internet. Through the Google for Education service (Google Workspace),
subscribed by UTM, ISI offers institutional e-mail addresses to students
( prenom.nom@etudiant-isi.utm.tn ) as well as to members of the academic and administrative staff
( firstname.lastname@isi.utm.tn ). Email remains the preferred means of communication until the implementation
operation of the future ISI portal and its extranet spaces. The ISI also has free access
to online digital libraries such as "IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Scien ce Direct" thanks to a
connection via the local network to CNUDST services.  
ISI was among the first institutions in Tunisia to adopt the training approach
distance learning (FAD 90% online) to support face-to-face training from 2009. This has come to fruition
 
 
13
 
by launching, in partnership with the UVT, the MP2L master via the EAD Moodle platform. The
catalog of training courses has expanded. In addition to MP2L training, ISI offers other
online professional masters courses (mentioned above in collaboration with the CNFCPP,
using the platform www.ipst.edunet.tn.). Thus, thanks to this experience, the ISI distinguished itself during
from the COVID period by managing to quickly migrate to a fully integrated training model.
online for the majority of its teachings
ISI uses the anti-plagiarism solution "PlagPrevent" to preserve the scientific integrity of works
academic work of students. This solution detects unauthorized similarities between work,
thus ensuring a fair assessment. Its use aims to reduce legal risks and to
demonstrate its commitment to ethical academic practices. Since its inception,
the use of this solution is systematically required when submitting internship reports.
PFE/SFE.
For several years, the ISI has implemented a strategy promoting the adoption of digital technology in
all of its administrative services in order to facilitate exchanges between its various stakeholders. This
strategy has been implemented through several pilot projects, including:
- The adoption of the Moodle platform as a distance learning platform (EAD);
- Automatic scheduling of sessions on Google Meet with invitation of speakers,
thus supporting the EAD platform;
- Partial digitalization of the student registration process;
- The implementation of monitoring dashboards at the examination service level (feedback from
notes, complaints management);
- Internship management;
- The use of Google Drive bringing together all the official documents of the establishment such as
than timetables, catch-up requests, wish lists, etc.  
Based on feedback from the various pilot projects, the ISI has begun implementing
of a new web portal with an extranet space. This solution aims to strengthen applications
(timetable management, grade entry, etc.). The new portal thus makes it possible to
break down the barriers between the different services to enable better interaction. The main
The objectives of the new portal are to increase the visibility of the institute and its research structures and
to offer an extranet space dedicated to students, teachers and administrative staff.
A.5.4 Financial means  
The institution has a transparent system for the internal distribution of financial resources
(Appendix A.15). “Title I” of the ISI budget is set each year in consultation between the departments
financial statements of the ISI and those of the Ministry. The ISI then manages its budget, in accordance with its status
EPA. "Title II" comes primarily from environmental outreach activity,
research and engineering program contracts and competitive research projects as well
national and international. The financial report is presented each year to the scientific council of
ISI. The distribution of financial resources by heading is carried out by looking at expenditure
relative to the previous year and depending on the evolution of the number of students. The average cost
annual per student of the training is of the order of 3979 D. As an EPA, the ISI is subject to a
control of expenditure a priori ensured by public expenditure controllers. Referring to
Article No. 3 of Decree No. 2012-2878 of 19/11/2012 relating to the control of public spending, the
control consists of examining the regularity of the following elements (the object, the imputation and the accuracy
assessment of expenditure, availability of credits, conformity of expenditure with works
budget preparation, compliance of expenditure with laws and regulations in force, the
 
 
14
 
compliance of expenditure with the appropriations use program and with annual programming
provided for in Article 11 of this decree). Another regularity check is carried out by the accounting officer
under the Ministry of Finance before proceeding with the payment of any order. The verification
relates to the quality of the authorising officer and the allocation of expenditure, the existence of the prior visa
the commitment and accuracy of the imputation and the justification of the service provided. Given that the ISI
is a public administrative establishment, accounting and budgetary management is ensured
by the AD AB application which is an information system shared by all stakeholders in the
expenditure (High Budget Committee, Authorizing Officers, Expenditure Controllers and Public Accountants).  
The ADAB application ensures the management of the complete chain of public expenditure, the maintenance of
real-time budget accounting, as well as the development of situations and reports
accountants and a variety of dashboards.
The ISI comprises a single research laboratory which receives its funding from the Ministry of
higher education and scientific research. Title II of the ISI has been strengthened by
funding from national and international competitive projects such as the support project for
quality (PAQ-DGSE), the Tunisian-Korean research project, etc.

B THE MANAGEMENT OF THE INSTITUTE: ITS PILOTAGE, ITS
OPERATION AND ITS QUALITY SYSTEM
B.1 Principles of steering and management  
Since 2014, in response to training and awareness initiatives carried out by UTM in the
within the framework of the Quality Support Project PAQ-CG 01/2014 Loan 7392-TN, several teachers as well as
administrative and technical staff participated in training dedicated to the design and
development of Quality Management Systems (QMS) (Appendix B.1). After these training courses, a
The first Quality Committee (QC) was appointed. In 2016, the quality initiative was launched during
the first edition of the quality day (Annex B.2), during which experts presented
the four strategic areas, namely Governance, Training, University Life and
Research. To crown this event, ISI was awarded the World Quality Award
Commitment “WQC” GOLD category in 2017 (Appendix B.3).
And since then, management has been committed to establishing a quality culture within
the establishment trying to work in accordance with the quality assurance guidelines
in European (ESG) and African (ASG) higher education.
Thanks to the funds allocated for the Quality Support Projects (QSP) of higher education,
in particular the PAQ Development of Strategic Management of Universities (PAQ-DGSU) and especially
that of the ISI focused on the Development of Strategic Management of Establishments (PAQ-DGSE),
named PAQ RISE-ISI (Accountability, Innovation, Synergy and Guarantee of Excellence of the ISI), the ISI has put
put in place an action plan for the certification of the establishment according to the ISO 21001 standard  
2018 version and the accreditation of its engineering courses as previously mentioned in the
chapter A.  
B.1 Quality approach  
B.1.1 Quality policy  
The quality policy within ISI is closely linked to the implementation of the ISO 21001 standard
:2018. Based on the continuous improvement approach, the ISI regularly reassesses and communicates
its educational objectives. Submitted and approved by the scientific council, the quality policy of
ISI supports management's commitment to a quality approach with the following objectives:
- Strengthen the effectiveness of governance;
- Provide training focused on increased employability;
- Revitalize and modernize student life.
 
In this process and ensuring the support of learners, teachers and staff,
ISI works to:
1. Ensure adequate resources to improve educational services offered to the parties
stakeholders;
2. Encourage research excellence and promote its recognition in the face of challenges
current scientists;
3. Strengthen the visibility of the institute and consolidate its links with its socio-environment
economic.
 
The ISI leadership, guided by its vision, is committed to:
 
 
16
 
1. Provide quality training in the field of computer science and ICT,
and maintain a strategic vision focused on educational and scientific innovation;
2. Improve the satisfaction of internal and external stakeholders by implementing a
listening and evaluation process in accordance with the institute's strategy;
3. Asserting its social responsibility by guaranteeing the protection of intellectual property
and personal of learners and other stakeholders;
4. Ensure accessibility and equity of learning while respecting ethical principles
by combating fraudulent practices.
 
The adoption of this quality approach resulted in the definition of eleven (11) processes describing the good
operation and implementation of the quality management system at ISI as indicated in
global mapping (see Figure B-1).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure B-1: ISI Process Mapping
To develop the various processes and their procedures, a participatory approach was established
within the ISI. In the following, we present the objectives and indicators of two processes
operational, namely the pedagogical process and the process of the learners' schooling. All
The processes have been developed 70% and implemented (Annex B.4).   
Educational Process: EXD - 06
This process, implemented according to the ISO 21001 standard, has the following objectives:
- Objective 1: Ensure the planning and completion of examinations on time while respecting
circulars;
- Objective 2: Guarantee the execution of examinations under controlled conditions (confidentiality,
logistics) ;
- Objective 3: Minimize incidents during the conduct of examinations;
- Objective 4: Ensure deliberations are held on time.

 
 
17
 
Monitoring of this process and its improvement is done via consistent indicators such as:
- Rate of compliance with planned examination activities within the deadlines;
- Satisfaction rate of learners and teachers regarding the execution of exams;
- Rate of submission of exam subjects on time;
- Rate of processing of complaints relating to the performance of examinations;
- Attendance rate of supervisors.
The details of the process flow, procedures and supporting documents are described in
(Annex B.5).
 
Learner Education Process: GSA - 07
This process, implemented according to the ISO 21001 standard, has the following objectives:
- Objective 1: Satisfy the needs (in documents) of learners related to their education;
- Objective 2: Guarantee the registration of all learners on time;
- Objective 3: Satisfaction of claims and complaints processed within the time limits
learners;
- Objective 4: Satisfaction of learners with specific needs.
Monitoring and improving this process is done using consistent indicators such as:
- Rate of satisfaction of document requests within the deadlines;
- Rate of students registered within the time limits prescribed in the press release;
- Rate of efficiency of processing claims and complaints processed within the time limits;
- Efficiency rate of processing complaints from learners with specific needs in
the deadlines.
The detailed plan of this process describes more elements (Appendix B.6).
B.1.2 Continuous improvement  
In 2019, as part of the UTM PAQ DGSU project, the ISI CpQ produced a report
self-assessment in accordance with the IEAQA (National Authority for the Evaluation,
Quality Assurance and Accreditation,) and AQI-UMED (Annex B.7). This self-assessment process
made it possible to define the specific objectives of the ISI, then integrated into the objectives of the PAQ project
DGSE (PAQ RISE- ISI) (Appendix B.8). As part of this project, seven (07) members of the CpQ obtained
“Lead Auditor” certification while one member (01) was certified “Lead Implementer” in ISO
21001.  
In addition, in order to strengthen the skills of CpQ members as well as process pilots
of the UTM and its establishments, various training courses were provided, covering the standards
ISO 9001-2015, ISO 21001-2018, ISO 31001 and social responsibility. Ten members, including
members of the CpQ and CPs participated in training on quality assessment
programs in higher education, covering the following aspects: self-assessment
internal, external evaluation, drafting of the evaluation report, as well as the development and
monitoring the implementation of the action plan. Therefore, the ISI was selected as
pilot establishment to conduct the course evaluation surveys, thus inaugurating the
process through training provided within the ISI (Annex B.9).
B.1.3 External quality approach outside CTI  
To set up the SMOE, a team of experts was mobilized to support the team
quality within the framework of the PAQ DGSE RISE -ISI project (Annex B.10). This deployment began with the
carrying out an initial diagnostic audit (Appendix B.11). Following this audit, a preliminary version
mapping has been developed, process drivers have been designated, and a series of
 
 
18
 
training was provided in accordance with the requirements of ISO 21001:2018 regarding
processes, mapping, dashboard and risk management. The file for the
certification has been submitted and the corresponding call for tender has already been published (Annex B.12).
B.1.4 Internal quality approach
The quality approach implemented at the ISI is based on a self-assessment which draws on
satisfaction surveys. These surveys target different stakeholders, including learners, the
administrative staff (Appendix B.13), teachers (Appendix B.14) and former graduates as well
than industrialists [Details in Chapter G].  
The main objective of this self-assessment is to enable the establishment to identify its points
strengths and weaknesses, and to work towards improving its performance in the short and medium term
term.
In the following, we will present the results of the student satisfaction survey (Appendix
B.15), as well as the areas subject to self-assessment and the conclusions drawn from the analysis
of these results.  
  
a. Self-assessment domain
The main areas of self-assessment that the CpQ has focused on include:  
- Choice of training and visibility of the institute;
- Educational resources;
- Quality of training;
- Student life;
- General assessment of the training.
b. Self-assessment results
The most recent satisfaction survey was launched at the end of the first half of the year.
university in progress, involving the participation of 169 registered students. It is possible that the
participation rate increases in the next surveys. The partial results of the survey of
learner satisfaction are presented below, while the full results are
available in annexes.
 
- Choice and visibility of training  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure B-2: Choice of training

 
 
19
 
Most of the students opted for ISI because of its reputation among institutions
offering similar training courses, which is a significant advantage for
the establishment (see Figure B-3).
 
- Educational resources
 
 
Figure B-4: Student satisfaction levels with logistics resources
Continuous efforts are being made to improve logistical and personnel resources. For example,
On the one hand, to compensate for the lack of personnel, the ISI called on a private company to
maintain the cleanliness of the premises and meet the required safety standards. On the other hand,
Regular updating of equipment in practical work laboratories is necessary for
meet changing needs. Thus, the various ISI projects can contribute to the financing
of these renewals (see Figure B-5).
 
- Quality of training
 
Students express satisfaction levels of up to 80% across all aspects
educational, with a few exceptions. However, this satisfaction decreases when it comes to
tutorials, mainly due to the lack of training in active pedagogy or other
alternative teaching methods. This observation has been identified as one of the areas for improvement
suggested by teachers in their satisfaction survey (see Figure B-6).
 
- Student life
 
Following the allocation of funds from the PAQ, renovations to the ISI club premises have
significantly improved these spaces. However, due to the current condition of the building and
the increase in the number of students, some cannot fully benefit from these
improvements. ISI strongly encourages students to participate in cultural activities and
social, thus promoting meaningful skills development and preparing them to excel
during national and international competitions (see Figure B-5).

whether at local, national, European or international level. This is achieved through
partnerships established with similar institutions as well as with various actors from the socio-economic world -
economic.  
This multidimensional approach is based on several initiatives, such as the organization
media events, field visits, involvement of experts in the process of
training, as well as the promotion of collaborations between teaching staff and businesses.
Among the agreements and exchange procedures undertaken by the ISI, we can cite the creation of co-curriculums -
diploma (Annex C.1), the invitation of professors from European universities and the reception of
foreign students. The ISI also adopts a strategy of innovation, entrepreneurship and
valorization of research results as well as their socio-economic impacts. At the same time,
The institute regularly ensures that it promotes its communications policy and its visibility on a global scale.
national and international. These initiatives are subject to regular evaluation with a view to
continuous improvement.
C.1 Territorial anchoring
Location of ISI  
Located near three sites renowned for their strong industrial activity and their ecosystems
innovation and research (Technpôle El Ghazala, the Northern Urban Center and the Industrial Zone
Charguia), the ISI takes advantage of its privileged geographical location to:
- Facilitate the sharing of PFE internship opportunities, job offers and the integration of
engineers in the industrial ecosystem.
- Promote the transfer of knowledge and understanding between the student, the teacher and
the company. For example, the El Ghazala technology hub offers a space for
conference which hosted several events organized by the ISI and its structures allowing
to promote synergy and dynamics bringing together academic stakeholders in the fabric
local industrialist.
- Exploit the proximity of El Ghazala Innovation Center at the technological hub level as
as an incubator that encourages and guides student entrepreneurs. In this context, we can
cite the startup “Unfrauded” founded by ISI students in 2019 which offers
smart solutions for fraud detection.
ISI's openness to its environment  
The ISI establishes relationships with high schools, colleges in the region as well as high school graduates in order to
promote its engineering training and engineering professions and encourage social diversity
within its sectors. With this in mind, visit and training initiatives are carried out at

UTM-INNOV  
As part of the UTM PAQ-GAGE project, a competition aimed at rewarding initiatives
innovative and entrepreneurial was launched in 2021. The success of the EPACT project, focused on
Social entrepreneurship in the production of 100% Tunisian concentrated feed for animals
breeding, was announced in October of the same year. Thanks to this project, Enactus ISI has succeeded in  
highlighting ISI, Tunisia, Arab countries and the African region by winning several
distinctions: the title of champion at the national Enactus Tunisia competition in June 2022, followed by the
Vice-champion title at the international Enactus World Cup competition in Puerto Rico in October
2022.
 
Student-Entrepreneur Center  
At the ISI, three teachers act as referents representing a point of liaison between the
students and the UTM student entrepreneur center (P2EUTM). Their role consists of coaching
students who apply for student entrepreneur status. This center is supported and accompanied
by the North Africa management of the AUF. It aims to promote the entrepreneurial spirit of
students, encourage their innovative initiatives in synergy and complementarity with the actions
and existing structures. It also works to federate good practices
entrepreneurial activities, thus creating the necessary conditions to establish an environment conducive to
the creation and development of start-ups by UTM students.
 
Course on innovation and entrepreneurship  
ISI offers courses at different levels and specialties providing students with knowledge and
skills required to find an original and innovative project idea, establish and validate
a personal assessment, carry out the various feasibility studies of a creation project
business, create a Business Model Canvas (BMC), design a draft of their product
(prototype, web application, model, mockup, etc.)  
 
Project 4C- Incubation  
In accordance with the 1999 Framework Convention between the Minister of Higher Education and the
Minister of Industry, the 4C center signed an agreement with the Industry Promotion Agency
and Innovation to promote the development of startups and innovative projects by offering
young entrepreneurs and ISI students an environment conducive to creation and sharing
ideas and access to the resources needed to make their projects a reality.  
C.4 National partnerships and networks
Over the years, the ISI has forged cooperations that give it special recognition.
present, our institute is committed to actively contributing to national networks and encouraging
partnerships.

Academic Partnerships - Worker Training
As part of these actions, the ISI establishes academic cooperation, in particular with
higher education institutions such as UVT since 2009, the Open School of
workers (IPST) since 2023 and recently the AUF. The objective of these collaborations is to provide
continuing education for workers through distance learning platforms
made available by partners (Annex C.5).
 
Communication/Dissemination Policy
Through the different media channels
(Written press, radio broadcasts, TV broadcasts),
ISI communicates on its activities and the
main events that it organizes. This
approach strengthens dialogue and dissemination
information to the general public (see
Figure C-7).
The ISI is particularly committed to sharing its
news and its actions through networks
social networks, especially on its official page
Facebook which has more than 11,000 subscribers
and its website.
 
Figure C-8: Announcement of the ISI Enterprise Forum 2022 - Express FM radio
Participation in national events
Following the same strategic approach, the ISI is keen to be active in events on a global scale
national. For example, in March 2023, the Institute participated in the “CarrièreIT” fair through a
exhibition stand and a radio appearance organized by the renowned national media channel, EXPRESS
FM. This event had more than 3000 participants (schoolchildren, students, professionals,
job seekers, teachers, etc.). In addition, ISI also participated as a partner
scientist of the event "Cybersecurity MEA conference" organized by the Tunisian branch of the
German company SAMA Partners and AICTO (Arab Information Technology Organization)
and communication) on September 19, 2023 (Annex C.6).
 
C.5 International partnerships
The ISI to further consolidate the policy of exchange with the international already in force through
including internships abroad, joint degrees, invitations to visiting teachers and
welcoming foreign students.
- Over the past three years, engineering students have completed internships abroad in
around thirty organizations, including companies and research laboratories (Appendix
C.7).
- Partnerships have been established with various higher education institutions abroad
promoting exchanges of students and teachers within the framework of agreements (Université Paris
13, INP-ENSEEIHT - Toulouse, ESTIA - Bidart).
- On the other hand, each year, work-study scholarships are awarded by the Tunisian State for the benefit of
engineering students candidates who are doing their PFE abroad. According to an order of merit, they
benefit from plane tickets and/or a monthly scholarship of 1000 euros.

 
 
27
 
In this context, the ISI's international exchange policy has also been implemented through
the invitation of teacher-researchers from European universities (France, Portugal, Bologna, etc.)
in recent years to lead conferences and training sessions in their
areas of expertise (see Table C-4).

D ENGINEER TRAINING
D.1 Development of the training project
The field of information and communication technologies (ICT) in Tunisia plays a role
essential in the country's economic growth thanks to the rapid evolution of the professions
digital. National and international surveys have been conducted to assess the world
information technology (IT) professional. These studies carried out by organizations such as
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in partnership with the National ICT Federation (UTICA)
and the Cooptalis firm show a continuous evolution of employment opportunities in the sector
IT in Tunisian and French companies. Another study, carried out by France Stratégie
and Dares, predicted a 26% increase in the developing engineering sector
IT and new technologies by 2030, which corresponds to 115,000 new positions
compared to 2019. Aware of technological developments and the needs of the sector
digital, the ISI has been engaged for several years in an essential and delicate process,
requiring a thorough understanding of national and international market requirements as well
than the aspirations of students. On the other hand, the policy implemented by the State aims to
promote the growth rate of the ICT sector and attract more potential investors. This
policy translates into actions such as easy data outsourcing, tax exemption
imported computer equipment, encouraging the creation of skilled jobs and
creation of IT companies. This demonstrates the importance of this sector and represents one
major assets of the ISI training project. Furthermore, Tunisia is increasingly attracting
of European and foreign companies operating mainly in the field of IT
and IT (Annex D.1). Regionally, the majority of these companies are located in the
Greater Tunis (67%), which is also a major asset for ISI students.
In this perspective, the ISI has engaged in a continuous process of development and design
programs aimed at offering its future engineers agile training, capable of adapting
quickly to technological developments while being aware of the inherent challenges and risks
to technological progress. Referring to the studies mentioned above which have allowed
to establish a ranking of the 20 most sought-after IT professions, the ISI offers training
engineers focused on top-ranked professions such as DevOps Expert, Data Scientist,
IoT engineer, as well as professions associated with the cloud and IT security of systems.
In addition to their scientific skills acquired through current training, engineers
ISI graduates have the capacity for innovation, ingenuity, critical thinking, and an aptitude
to self-training to meet scientific, technological and socio-economic challenges. They are
also equipped with a social conscience and a broad vision of their field of expertise.
In order to ensure the smooth running of the training course as well as the monitoring and continuous evaluation
engineers, ensuring that it meets market demands while providing education
At a high level, it is essential to involve stakeholders, including teachers,
students, industry and experts. This is reflected in the establishment of educational committees
(equivalent to the improvement council or CP) within each department with the aim of
promote dialogue between teachers of the same discipline, students and representatives
from the professional world.  
The educational committee (PC) is made up of:  
- Director of the department concerned, who chairs it,
- Teachers responsible for modules under the department’s responsibility,
- Teachers working in the same discipline and participants in said modules,
 
 
29
 
- One to two engineering students representing the current course, invited according to
the need for the agenda,
- Two to three representatives from the professional community (experts and temporary workers).  
The CP has been validated by the scientific and operational council since the 2022-2023 academic year
(Appendix D.2). It meets at least once every six months. Its mission is to issue shares
corrective measures to improve the quality of training taking into account feedback from surveys
industrialists in order to update the training content as well as the learning methods
adopted.  
The CP also takes into consideration feedback from the Student Representative Council.
(CRE). The latter brings together representatives of each group of students with management and allows
to effectively report their complaints and suggestions. The representatives are elected by the
students from their respective groups at the beginning of each academic year. This council is
completed by official student delegates elected to represent them on the Scientific Council.
D.2 Targeted skills
ISI offers engineering training supported by a wide variety of scientific disciplines
and technological developments arising from the needs of the national and international labor market and which represent
IT training. ISI training is available in three engineering degrees:
distinct specialties in digital professions, namely.
- Software Development Engineering (IDL)  
- Embedded Systems and Connected Objects Engineering (ISEOC)  
- Engineering and Development of Infrastructures and Communications Services (IDISC).
D.2.1 Training objectives and skills targeted
To prepare engineering students for careers, the objectives of engineering training in  
digital services offered in our establishment are:
- Objective 1. Acquire an in-depth and advanced mastery of theoretical concepts and tools
scientific and technical related to engineering sciences,  
- Objective 2. Acquire advanced skills in solving and implementing
complex problems related to each of the specialties of the targeted professions,
- Objective 3. Acquire knowledge of ethical and social issues and self-development
personnel and communication,
- Objective 4. Have the managerial capacity to manage and undertake projects as well as the
culture and industrial openness (Softskills).
To achieve these objectives, ISI training is carried out using the professional skills approach.
identified by several skills reference systems: the Jobs/Skills reference system developed by
UTICA and the World Bank in 2017 and updated in 2020 and the IFC, REM/REC, OPEIIC benchmarks
and RTMC, developed by the National Agency for Employment and Independent Work (ANETI). These
skills selected include the generic skills recommended by the reference framework
accreditation for all engineering training and a set of specific skills that
list the skills expected of the engineer.
In its study plan, the ISI targets skills that meet the expectations of engineering professions.
In order to guarantee the maximum match between the profiles of graduate engineers and the requirements
of the job market, the ISI identifies failures, gaps and weak points in order to define the
updates and corrective actions. This improvement approach based on market need

increase according to a ranking established from an online survey Katalyse/erdyn. The professions
related to new technologies such as DevOps Expert, Data Scientist have marked the last
decade. The current professions targeted by the ISEOC course are the Engineer and Architect professions
in embedded and IoT. According to the Forrester Institute predicts that IoT is moving from experimental scale to
commercial scale and that specialized IoT platforms will develop to facilitate access
to connected solutions. Indeed, the number of connected object projects has increased by 500% in
three years in the world, and French companies have invested more than 30 billion euros in
2017. The professions targeted by the IDISC course are professions in constant evolution according to the firm
Robert Half. Companies' strategic priorities are focused on cloud-related projects,
computer security of systems. Indeed, between 2016 and 2019, the global cloud market
public reached 233 billion dollars in turnover (International Data Corporation). With

Indeed, the three disciplines of engineering aim to develop skills
professions from several professional sectors meeting an identified and significant need relating to the
design of software systems, embedded systems, telecommunications networks,
new technologies, intelligent and communicating systems, etc. These sectors of the future,
carriers of technological innovations, offer our graduates excellent integration opportunities

D.3 Engineering diploma in initial training
Since the creation of the engineering cycle at ISI, the strategic orientation, as mentioned
previously in chapter A, is to offer high-level engineering training in
the various activities related to the field of digital professions. Thus, the duration of training
engineering program is spread over three academic years divided into six semesters in total. The first five
semesters of study mainly concern the academic part of teaching. Internships
(Semesters S2 and S4) as well as the final study project (Semester S6) take place in the environment
industrial constitute the professional part of the apprenticeship.  
The lessons are organized into teaching units (UE) grouping together elements
constitutive (ECUE) which are provided in the form of courses (C), tutorials (TD) and assignments
practical (TP) and personal work (TPE). These modules are delivered over a period of 1h30. The
form of ECUE teachings, their hourly volumes, their coefficients, the credits of the
The tests relating thereto, as well as the methods of assessment, are defined in the study plan of
each sector which are communicated to interested parties on the ISI website.
- The ECUEs respond to the generic and specific skills targeted by the training, the
time volumes in person and independently (personal work) and the different
teaching methods (C, TD, TP and TPE) are illustrated in the study plans (Appendix D.3).
- The common core is spread over three common semesters (S1 -S3) guaranteeing acquired knowledge
skills common to all engineering students in the sector, allowing them to integrate
all engineering professions such as new technologies, multimedia, networks
and security as well as the management of services and projects. The other three semesters (S4 -S6)
provide training in one of the following specialties: IDL, ISEOC or IDISC.
- The number of engineering students per class does not exceed 35 students for courses and 17
students for practical work carried out in teaching laboratories.  
- The teaching semesters have an effective duration of 15 weeks, including one week
assessment (Annex D.4).
D.3.1 Architecture and training program

Distribution of hourly workload according to CS families
 
 
Figure D-13: Distribution of the overall load by CS families for the three sectors
In Figure D-13, which illustrates the distribution of hourly volume by skill family for the
three sectors, it is clear that the first family of skills "scientific and technical tools"
allows the engineering student to master the scientific tools necessary to be able to solve and
deal with the problems encountered.  
We can observe that the second family of skills “technological skills and monitoring
"scientific" specific to each sector, plays a predominant role in the three sectors. This involves
to acquire advanced skills in solving and implementing complex problems
linked to each of the specialties of the targeted professions. The third family of skills
"communication, management, personal development and innovation" allows future
engineers to master managerial skills, business culture and languages
foreign. The engineering student, beyond these scientific skills, will have the power
to undertake, innovate and self-develop on a personal and relational level, through
personal work, mini-projects, introductory and advanced training courses and PFE.
These skills cover teamwork and communication in a professional setting.
and public.  
Assessment of acquired skills
In order to ensure the skills acquired by our engineering students at ISI at the end of their studies
training courses, the assessment of the latter is carried out according to the averages obtained in each
ECUE feeding the relevant skill according to the following methodology/formula:  
 
ηj = ∑i(ci*xi,CSJ)  
∑here
With, Xi, CSJ: the % percentage having more than the average 10/20
in ECUE i of competence j;
Ci: level of learning outcomes of ECUE i (Ci ranging from 1 to 3)
Figure D-14: Skills Assessment
 

 
 
37
 
For the year 2022-2023, the assessment of acquired professional skills in the IDL sector is illustrated
in Figure D-14. We note more than 50% of skills acquired from the main session. This rate
has been improved taking into account the catch-up session. The results of the observations of the
specific skills for the three sectors during the last three promotions for both
main and catch-up sessions are provided in (Appendix D.6).  
Following the observation of the low rates of acquisition of CS1 skills during the year
2019/2020 university, the input selection criteria have been revised to improve the
prerequisites (change of selection formulas [Details in Chapter E] and student engineers
have since been made aware of the importance of CS1 and the basic scientific modules associated with these
skills. And for several years, the increase in the rate of acquisition of the CS1 skill is
justified by the fact that ISI inputs are among the best graduate students with bachelor's degrees who
come from the best scores among high school graduates nationwide.
D.3.1.1 Major criteria for in-company training
Engineering students are encouraged to put into practice their theoretical training and
techniques by carrying out three types of compulsory internships under student status, during their course
training at the ISI (Appendix D.7). Thus, all engineering students are required to complete three internships
mandatory and as follows:
- An introductory course, "worker quality", lasting between 4 and 8 weeks, at the end of the
first year in which the engineering student becomes familiar with the environment, the operation
and the organizational methods of the company. This aims to integrate the student engineer
in the socio-economic environment and the industrial environment.  
- A refresher course, “technician quality”, carried out in a public company or
private, national or international, or in a research structure, for a duration of between
4 and 8 weeks, at the end of the second year during which the student is required to use
specific skills relating to the performance of certain tasks according to specifications
required by the supervisor of the industrial environment in which the internship is carried out.
 
These two internships must be concluded with an internship report and the preparation of a journal.
internship including daily tasks performed. At the end of each internship, the engineering student must
complete an internship certificate issued by the host organization.  
 
- A Final Year Project (PFE) is carried out either in a public or private company, or in a
research structure belonging to the ISI or in other research structures in Tunisia or in
abroad lasting between 16 and 24 weeks, where the future engineer can put his acquired skills to good use
of skills to solve or improve a solution to an industrial problem in the field
of the digital profession. This PFE is jointly supervised by a teacher
permanent staff of the Institute and an industrial supervisor in the host organization. It is validated by a
defense before a jury appointed by the director of the Institute after advice from the director of the
department. Validation of the PFE is a necessary condition for obtaining the diploma
candidate's national engineer certificate (Annex D.8).

D.3.1.2 Major criteria for training through research
In accordance with the strategic orientations defined in Chapter A, the ISI adopts an approach of
research-based training aimed at stimulating the spirit of analysis and creativity in its students
engineers. The ISI teacher-researchers, as committed academics, combine their
research, teaching, technology transfer and project creation activities and
teams to enrich their expertise and skills in their respective fields.
The introduction of new modules based on project-based teaching methods and in
teams comes to strengthen the training of engineers at ISI. In addition, since 2021, ISI has offered its
third-year engineering students wishing to deepen their innovation capabilities and
analysis the possibility of integrating the research master in the second year. This initiative
demonstrates ISI's commitment to training engineers who are aware of the importance of research
scientific. Furthermore, the research structures of the ISI, or those in other establishments
national or international universities, welcome engineering students to carry out their PFEs
as part of their research activities. This contributes significantly to the granting of our students
engineers with additional specific skills in research and technological innovation
and this, by working alongside doctoral students and experienced researchers. Feedback on the results
PFEs contribute significantly to improving the learning outcomes of our engineering students.
These activities also influence through the research results carried out by the body
teacher on the quality of teaching by integrating them into the training curriculum provided
at the Institute for our engineering students.
D.3.1.3 Major criteria for training in social and environmental responsibility
In accordance with the strategic vision set out in Chapter A, the design of the programs of
Training at ISI promotes innovation by taking into account the needs of society in terms of
values ​​such as sustainability, ethics and social responsibility. ISI is committed to training
engineers with professional conscience, with regular discussions on ethics
professional and the social implications of their decisions. In addition, the training of engineers in
ISI includes a Personal and Professional Project (PPP) which can provide a framework for designing
initiatives addressing social or environmental issues while integrating
sustainable practices. In addition, the training of engineers is enriched by activities within
 
 
39
 
clubs, some of which initiatives, such as Enactus ISI [Details in Chapters C and F], act
specifically on social responsibility and sustainable development at the regional level.
 
D.3.1.4 Major criteria for training in innovation and entrepreneurship
ISI adopts a clear policy towards innovation and entrepreneurial approach through
the training and personal self-development of its engineering students. Thus, the ISI:
- Develops a culture and spirit of openness to innovation and entrepreneurship through
of courses, workshops and specific mini-projects. Business creation training
includes awareness, innovation and knowledge transfer modules. These
modules allow ISI engineering students to acquire skills for the
launching, defining, and realizing a project idea.
- Promotes the creation of innovative businesses via the new “Student Status” label -
Entrepreneur” created by UTM.
- Organizes, in collaboration with its partners, actions, awareness days and
programs to encourage its future engineers to create businesses. These
programs are a means of meeting with entrepreneurs, “Success Stories”
and ISI alumni to share their experiences [Details in Chapter C].
- Provides its engineering students with long-term support systems
project leaders, in particular material, financial and personal resources via its Center for
Career and Skills Certification (4C) and the PAQ-DGSE-RISE project. This allows
consolidate their learning in entrepreneurship and innovation.
D.3.1.5 Major criteria for training in the international and multicultural context
As part of preparation for the international and multicultural context, the teaching of
languages ​​and soft skills is mandatory for engineering students. In addition to the aspects
communication and linguistic, these lessons aim to prepare the student for a
other cultural environment and international mobility opportunities realized the most
frequently on internship. Soft skills are also the subject of socio-cultural activities encouraged
by the establishment, whether in clubs, certification centers, national competitions and
international. As part of cultural openness, the ISI welcomes some foreign students
[Details in Chapter F].
D.3.2 Consistency between targeted skills and training program
The skills benchmarks, differentiated for the three sectors, come from a reflection
involving all the teachers from the four departments of the ISI. This reflection is the result
from an analysis of the evolution of training based on a skills-based approach which links
the market study for the professions targeted by our training, the professions targeted by the skills
specific skills derived from the generic CTI skills of the Engineer, the specific skills
to the modules taught and justifying their credits, their time charges in person (face to face)
and independently (personal work), etc. The link between the targeted learning outcomes and the
skills are explained in the syllabuses. The annexes summarize the respective distributions
learning outcomes across the different teaching units (Appendix D.9).
The drafting of the reference documents also made it possible to better explain the specific features of the training.
with the various stakeholders (students, teachers, alumni, businesses, etc.) to make
evolve learning and better guide learners to adequately prepare them for the market
employment. The skills-based approach also leads to the adoption of new methods
 
 
40
 
educational such as self-assessment of skills acquired by each learner
(evaluations of internships, projects, modules, etc.).  
Departments regularly launch partial curriculum reform projects
with the aim of improving the rate of integration of graduates and improving the general visibility of the
training to have a better quality of students admitted to this training. These experiences of
reformulations are based on the coherence between the learning objectives (Learning Outcomes)
and the training outcomes, which reflects the ISI's responsiveness to technological developments and
to the requirements of the socio-economic world through surveys of industrialists.
training aligns with the principle of active pedagogy and is inspired by the real and meaningful context for
the student. It is based on activities of application, analysis, evaluation, synthesis and
self-assessment and alternates between theoretical presentations, presented by the teacher and activities
practices, designed with a perspective promoting autonomy which empowers the student and makes
of him a full actor in the learning process. Practical activities can be
carried out by the student in the form of individual and group work with an experiential perspective
(problem-based learning, project-based learning, etc.) in order to develop one's capacity
to innovate, collaborate and promote solid and lasting learning. Learning from
The student is not limited to the academic framework, he also extends into the field, benefiting from a
continuous coaching and feedback throughout the process to inform him of his progress
while promoting self-assessment. The Moodle platform was chosen as a working tool
collaborative to provide support for teaching and learning.
D.3.2.1 Caesura
The gap in studies is not officially permitted by national legislation. In the same
meaning and for cases specified by national texts, the student engineer can however benefit
of a withdrawal of registration (Appendix D.10). The same texts stipulate that an engineering student has the right to
only one repeat  
D.3.3 Teaching methods
To meet the needs of the job market, teaching at ISI uses new
innovative educational approaches. Indeed, educational activities alternate between
theoretical teachings (Courses), supervised teachings (TD) where students benefit from a
face-to-face supervision to practice, practical lessons where students handle
tools to deepen their learning (TP), personal work which promotes
self-learning and federated and final-year projects carried out individually or in teams
and benefiting from personalized supervision. Students benefit from company visits in a
to involve industrialists. All these educational activities allow the ISI student engineer
to acquire fundamental knowledge and practical know-how, and to develop the spirit of
creativity and autonomy. In addition to these lessons imposed by the study plans, students
and ISI teachers benefit from the preparation for international certifications offered by
ISI certification centers and projects (Centers: 4C, CISCO, IBM, Huawei, RISE Project, etc.)
(Appendix D.11) [Details in Chapter C].
To vary learning methods and enrich teaching methods, some
lessons can be given remotely, up to 20% of the hourly load
authorized according to the texts, thus adopting a hybrid or mixed pedagogy, face-to-face and distance,
called Blended. This pedagogy uses a virtual classroom taking advantage of the Moodle platform to
better scripting.
 
 
 
41
 
Always to encourage creativity, innovation and autonomy, the ISI provides
engineering students the schedule of rooms and open access spaces available, to facilitate the
completion of their projects and personal work. The timetables have been arranged in such a way
to free up Wednesday afternoons for club activities.  
The study plan for each training course summarizes the balance between the different methods
pedagogical. All teaching methods are indicated in the syllabus of each
training. The study plan as well as the syllabus of all modules are available on the
ISI platform and displayed to students.  
D.3.3.1 Summative evaluation of UE and UCUE
Courses are assessed by written exams, lasting 1.5 hours, continuous assessment and homework.
supervised (DS) lasting 1h30. The DS covers the first part of the program
learning (between 6 and 7 weeks) and the exam covers the entire program organized in
a main session whose date and duration of the tests are set by management at the start of
the academic year after validation by the scientific council.  
- A schedule of examinations is established one week before the start of the
tests. A catch-up session is planned for at least one (1) week and four weeks
(4) at the latest after the proclamation of the main session.  
Any absence from one of the examination tests will result in a mark of zero (0).
continuous includes, depending on the form of teaching, supervised personal work, tests
written and/or oral and, where appropriate, practical tests.
The practical work is assessed each session according to an evaluation grid. This grid includes the grade of
each practical work session (30% of the overall mark) according to specific criteria, the mark of the report
(20% of the overall grade) and that of the practical work exam (50% of the overall grade).  
Internships and PFEs are assessed following a defense at the end of the semester in front of a
jury composed of academic staff and the industrial tutor.  
For each module, an average is calculated resulting from the marks obtained in the different
knowledge assessment tests. The weighting coefficients assigned to these tests
are set according to the form of teaching specific to each module as follows:  
- Modules organized in the form of courses and tutorials:  
o 1/3 continuous monitoring  
o 2/3 final exam  
- Modules organized in the form of courses, tutorials and practical work:  
o 2/3 theoretical grade (1/3 continuous assessment and 2/3 final exam)
o 1/3 mark for practical work  
- Modules organized exclusively in the form of practical work or tutorials:  
o 100% continuous monitoring.  
- Modules organized exclusively in the form of practical work or tutorials
may be subject to credit or catch-up.  
These weightings relating to the calculation of averages are validated by the scientific council and
communicated at the beginning of each year to learners and interested parties on the website
the Institute.
D.3.3.2 Progression and graduation
The engineering student is declared admitted to the main session by the examination deliberation council
when the engineering student has satisfied the following conditions:  
 
 
42
 
1. Obtaining a general average equal to or greater than 10/20, after the tests
main or catch-up. The general average is obtained from the averages of the
teaching units assigned their respective coefficients
2. Obtaining an average equal to or greater than 08/20 in each of the units
of teachings, after the main or catch-up exams. Calculation of the average
of each teaching unit takes into account the weighting coefficients set by the
study plan.
To access the final internship of the end-of-studies project (S6), you must have validated semester S5.  
D.3.3.3 Catch-up
The engineering student who has not obtained the general annual average benefits from a session of
catch-up for the teaching units where he did not obtain the average. This catch-up cannot
only concern modules where the engineering student did not get the average.  
The resit grade is only considered if it improves the exam grade, and in this case, it
replaces the final exam grade in calculating the average for the module concerned.  
D.3.3.4 Credits
The engineering student who, after the catch-up session, obtained a general average equal to or
greater than 10/20 and an average greater than 08/20 in at least three quarters of the units
of teaching, can be admitted to the next year with credit. From the academic year
2023-2024, the new class of engineering students, in their first year this year, will not
benefit more from admission with credits.  
In these teaching units, credit is awarded for the module(s) whose average is
less than 08/20 and this within the limit of four (4) modules with taking into account modules
previous not validated.  
A credit object module is validated when the new average of the teaching unit to which
it belongs is equal to or greater than 08/20.  
The credit modules are determined, for each credited engineering student, by the director of the Institute
on the proposal of the deliberation jury.
D.3.4 Teaching Teams
In order to ensure high-quality, nationally recognized engineering training and
international, the ISI mobilizes varied human and educational resources of essential quality
to develop the skills of the framework. This implies a commitment from teachers  
permanent as well as interventions by expert professionals as part-time teachers,
thus ensuring a fit with the needs of the professional world.
The supervision rate at the ISI is 1/12, which is considered satisfactory, knowing that the supervision rate
national is estimated at around 1/15.
D.3.4.1 Distribution by teacher grade
The majority of training is provided by the body of assistant professors (45%). The number of
teachers who provide training represent a percentage of 8% taking into account the
doctoral training within the Telecommunications department.
The intervention of experts in training, particularly in the 5th semester, is 17%,
which is a significant rate for such an engineering training. The percentage of permanent staff is
83% (average over the 5 semesters) of all stakeholders (see Figure D-145).

Distribution of annual hourly load
Regarding the distribution of the annual hourly load, the TPs and the TPEs cover a part
significant hourly volume over the five semesters and represent a volume of around 100%
training in the last semester S6. Given the importance of practical work, we aim to
reduce the time load of face-to-face training courses to make room for work
practices and specific work in self-learning.  
Indeed, it is clearly demonstrated that the rate of courses, TD and TP is clearly reduced during
the third year of this course leaving room for personal work which has increased by a
significantly during the third year. Which explains the importance of such work with regard to
improving the skills of the engineering student from the points of view of innovation, autonomy,
entrepreneurship and self-development. Figures that illustrate the distribution of courses, tutorials, practical work and
TPE during the three years of engineering training for the three IDL, ISEOC and IDISC streams are
provided in Appendix D.12.
 
Hourly volume in person vs. non-person  
The total load is on average 1919H face to face. The hourly volume of training
face-to-face training is on average 21.3 hours per week. During academic training and during
each semester, the component (C+TD) is the most dominant in the training, followed by practical work and
then the TPEs. Thus the practical hourly volume in non-face-to-face (TPE) is on average 4.6 hours

 
 
44
 
per week. The percentage of TPE in the first year is low and increases in the years
following.  
Figures which illustrate in percentage the distribution of the hourly load for each year of
face-to-face and non-face-to-face teaching respectively are provided in Appendix D.13.

Figure D-16 shows the evolution of the number of engineering students from 2019 to 2024, we note a
fluctuation in numbers over the years with groups between 24 and 31 for the first years
and groups of between 21 and 32 for the third years depending on the training.

E STUDENT RECRUITMENT
E.1 Objectives and admission pathways
In line with the strategic direction of the ISI, a student recruitment strategy is
developed to effectively accomplish its training mission. This approach takes into account
taking into consideration the reception capacities of the institute and aims to guarantee the quality of the training of its
graduates. The recruitment criteria, specific to each admissions stream, are adjusted according to
depending on the objectives of training and professional integration, with emphasis on
required skills.
E.1.1 Recruitment strategies
The procedures for national entrance exams for engineering training courses as well as the
specific competitions are governed in accordance with decree 94-62 of January 10, 1994 (Annex E.1). They
are organized by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRS)
in a rigorous and transparent manner according to the laws, decrees and orders which are published in
the Official Journal of the Tunisian Republic (JORT), on the website of the ministry and on the website
www.cningenieur.rnu.tn.
National competitions are managed by the General Directorate of Technological Studies (DGET)
under the MESRS. A steering committee ensures the running of the three phases of the competitions
namely: registration, recruitment and proclamation of results. The DGET sets through
orders (Annex E.2):
-Schools concerned by the specific national competition.
-The places available for each training course and sector of each school.
-Deadlines for submitting application files for students.
-The terms of the organization.
Revisions of Decree 94-62 of January 10, 1994 according to decrees, circulars and orders which
are published, have enabled the accreditation of higher institutes of applied sciences and technology,
including the ISI, to award the engineering diploma. The recruitment of engineers at the ISI is done
exclusively through a specific national competition (CS) within the limits of the reception capacity
of the institute. The admission requirements, dates, procedures and number of places are set
by the Ministry (Appendix E.3). This competition is based on files and is intended for deserving students who
have brilliantly completed the first cycle (Bachelor's degree) for admission to the first year of engineering,
and those who have completed the first year of the M1 master's degree for admission to the second year
engineer.
 
 
 
 
 
46
 
 
- Conditions and terms of admission  
Students who are eligible for admission to ISI must meet the following conditions:
Admission to the 1st year: Meritorious students who have obtained a national bachelor's degree from
LMD system in science and technology specializations and not having repeated their studies
academics and which are presented by their home institution.  
Two categories of students are to be considered: Candidates who have obtained their diplomas from
ISI licenses and students who have obtained their licenses from other institutes in the
mentions of science and technology.
Admission to 2nd year: Deserving students who have successfully completed their first year
of the LMD system master in science and technology specializations and not having repeated a year
in their university studies.
A press release is published by the ministry each year to set the conditions, deadlines,
terms and conditions and the number of places for each category. Candidates must submit their
application file through the website www.cningenieurs.rnu.tn respecting the deadlines set
by the ministry.  
E.1.2 Admission channels and reception capacity
The ISI's reception capacity is set by the scientific council and published in a press release
Ministry. The ISI reserves, annually, one hundred and twenty-five (125) places for non-university students
repeaters in the first year and five (5) students in the second year. However, it is the MERS,
as the competent authority, which sets the number of places available for students admitted to
ISI, as well as in all other engineering schools.
First year students are divided into two IDL groups of sixty (60) students, one
IDISC group of thirty (30) students and an ISEOC group of thirty (30) students. The ISI reserves 40%
of its capacity in the different sectors to its students who have obtained one of its three licenses:
CS, SE and IRS. The remaining places (60% of capacity) are intended mainly for students who
have obtained degrees in exact sciences and technology in the following courses (or equivalent)
: Computer Science, Computer Systems Engineering and Embedded Systems (including
including ISI students).  
For the second years, the five places are reserved for students who have successfully completed the
first year master. They are distributed as follows: two (02) places in the second year IDL, one
(1) place in the second year ISEOC and one (01) place in the second year IDISC.  
The ISI, during the four academic years (2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023), integrated an average of one hundred
nine (109) engineering students distributed as illustrated in Table E-1. It also demonstrates that
the gap between forecasts (announced places offered) and the number of integrations is limited.
The number of files submitted to the ISI is significant (estimated at more than 1200 files), however the
commission processes only 40% (having the highest scores). Table E-1 illustrates
also the percentage of files admitted which represents on average 18% of the files processed
and on average 9% of the files submitted. The number of engineering students is constantly
increase and the gap between reserved places and accepted applications decreases every year
to become zero this year.
 
 
 
 
 
 
47
 
 
Table E-1: evolution of the number and percentage of students admitted to the ISI.
Total 2020 2021 2022 2023

Percentage of accepted files 19% 18% 19% 17%
Difference from planned places -24 places -14 places -8 places 0 places
 
ISI stands out from other engineering schools with its three training courses: ISEOC, IDISC and
IDL. The latter represents the most attractive specialty of the institute according to the number of students
integrated per year and according to the percentages of applications for admission to the IDL specialty. Table E-
2 indicates the percentages of those admitted to the IDL specialty compared to the total number of
admitted exceeds 55% each year.

E.1.3 Score Calculation
A steering committee within the DGET studies the candidates' files in order to verify the
admission requirements and to calculate scores. Admitted candidates are those who are the best
classified in the two categories (1-A and 1-B) according to an overall score calculated on the basis of 100 points.
It corresponds to the linear combination of two scores: score A and score E (Appendix E.4).
The A score takes into account the criteria common to all engineering training establishments
concerned by the specific competitions and it is calculated in the manner described in this press release
published on the ministry's website. Candidates are admitted according to this score A calculated in a way
common for all establishments concerned by the competition.
The DGET then communicates to the ISI the files of the candidates pre-selected by the ministry according to
the first scale. A second scale is established for each branch of the institute which allows
classify candidates and retain them according to their order of merit, up to the number of places available, in
first year of engineering for graduate candidates and second year for M1s.
The E score is calculated according to a specific formula for each training establishment
engineers. It will be published on the site csingenieur.inscription.tn before the deadline for submitting applications.
application files.  
The ISI offers score calculation formulas for each of its three streams that are adapted to
different courses accepted. These scores are proposed by the department heads and validated by the
scientific council. The proposed formulas are adapted to the admissions streams and take into account
 
 
48
 
takes into account basic science subjects such as mathematics and subjects
fundamentals of the specialty in question. The formulas can be adapted from one year to another
other to ensure the levels of recruits. The institute checks the level of previous training
candidates, particularly in the basic sciences that concern the diploma. It ensures that the
previous training and the abilities of the recruited students are sufficient to achieve the objectives
of training and to enable the award of the diploma in order to guarantee the success of all
students. (Form 2020 Appendix E.5 and Formula 2023 Appendix E.6).
A commission is appointed by the director of the ISI. This commission is composed of a president,
who is the director of the ISI himself, and four members, including at least one teacher from
each department (Appendix E.7). Its main mission is to verify the conditions of admission
(accepted courses, non-repeating candidate, etc.) and to calculate the E score for each candidate.
A list ranked according to an overall score is then sent to the DGET which sets according to capacity
of the institute and the candidates' choices the final results. These results will be communicated to the
candidates, through the ministry's website, after validation by the national commission bringing together
the various deans of the establishments concerned by the specific competitions.  
Students who participated in the national preparatory school competition but refused the
specialties that have been assigned to them have the possibility of applying for admission to the ISI, provided that
that they complete a year to obtain a degree in one of the three specialties mentioned.
However, it should be noted that the admission rate of these students is generally low, because
When calculating the scores, they do not have grades in the core subjects of the
specialty in question.  
Access to engineering training is not limited to Tunisian students, foreign students
having Tunisian diplomas, also have the possibility of participating in these national competitions, which
will be subject to the same conditions and selection criteria as Tunisian students.
The ISI is also open to international students who have not graduated from Tunisia under the framework of a
international cooperation between the ministries of higher education and research
scientist from both countries.
E.2 Monitoring recruitment results
The ISI tracks recruitments from past years and analyses their results using information from
Candidates provide by completing an online form when registering and through
surveys carried out by the institute. As a result, the management defines an action plan allowing for a
on the one hand, to strengthen the diversity and social openness of its recruitment and on the other hand, to ensure that
its recruitment strategy is consistent with its training and employment strategy. A summary
statistics presents all the numerical data (Appendix E.8).
Study of sociological data:  
E.2.1.1 Diversity and social openness  
The institute ensures diversity of gender, geographical and social origins of its students
recruited.  
E.2.1.2 Percentage of women and men registered
New ISI registrants constitute a balanced group in percentage terms between the two genders.  
In fact, on average over four years, the percentage of male admissions is equal to 41% and
the percentage of female admissions is 59%.  
 
 
 
 
49
 
E.2.1.3 Geographic origin of students
The geographical origin of the students corresponds to the governorate of residence of the family home
declared by the students. The ISI also tries to guarantee a diversity of geographical origins
of his students through the media efforts that present his different training courses.
ISI engineers come from all over Tunisia. However, greater Tunis
(comprising the governorates of Tunis, Ariana, Manouba and Ben Arous) is the region that provides the
largest contingent of students with a percentage of 56.4%. Then, the governorate of Nabeul
with 15.9% and the governorate of Bizerte with 7.6% hold the second and third places. These
values ​​are explained by the influence of the factor of geographical proximity and competition
private engineering schools in cities like Sousse or Sfax.
E.2.1.4 Social level of students
The ISI is accessible to students from all social backgrounds (Appendix E.8). The institute integrates
students from different social and economic classes, which is also supported by the rate
average of students who obtained a scholarship which amounts to 32%. This university scholarship
is granted by the ministry to students from modest backgrounds in order to benefit from a
free excellence training.  
Registration fees are set by the Ministry of Higher Education and Research
scientific. For the 2022-2023 academic year, they amount to 60 DT (i.e. 13% of the amount of the minimum wage
monthly).
Educational data and development of the quality of recruits
The continuous effort made by the ISI to achieve its objectives has allowed an improvement in the ranking
new engineering students recruited and this is reflected in the evolution of the ranking of the
application for admission to the ISI in the establishments concerned by the competition to reach the
first place in 2022 and 2023 with applications (1st place) that reached more than 500
files.  
Figure E.1 certifies that ISI is the most requested institution by students in a way
general and by students with an A score above 80.  
 
 
Figure E-1: The ISI ranking in 2023 - Admission request based on the A and G scores of recruits
 
The improvement in the ranking of those admitted to the specific competition has led to an improvement in
the quality of students according to the grade obtained in the baccalaureate. During the last three years
(2020, 2021 and 2022), for the IDL, IDISC and ISE OC specialties we note an increase in
percentages of Good and Very Good mentions of 10% in 2022. The statistics of

 
 
50
 
admitted to the IDL specialty confirm that on average over three years, 50% of those admitted have had their
baccalaureate with honors (Good and Very Good). We also note an increase in the percentage
students from bachelor's degrees specializing in mathematics, which exceeds 50%. In addition,
more than 40% of selected students (2020, 2021 and 2022) were among the top 5 in their
promotions in license carried out in their institutions of origin.

F STUDENT LIFE AND ASSOCIATIVE LIFE OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS
F.1 Welcoming and integrating new students
At the beginning of each academic year, ISI welcomes new students, with special attention
particular focus on the quality of their integration. The institute organizes integration days
annual meetings to familiarize first-year students with their new environment. Thus,
These days offer the opportunity to interact with former advanced level students, as well
as well as with the various administrative structures, clubs and socio-economic partners. The ISI
undertakes to provide detailed information on the general discipline, university courses and
professional perspectives of engineers through meetings and presentations
organized during these days.
The ISI also provides students with a guide (Appendix F.1) containing the information
useful for the smooth running of their studies in a structured and simplified manner throughout
of their course. Information about ISI is also available on the ISI website
with useful links to calls for applications for masters, internship offers, the list of
administrative managers as well as the list of contact points for any educational problems,
psychological, medical or general.  
Students with special needs benefit from adapted and inclusive treatment at
within the ISI. Individualized accommodations are put in place for assessments, including

time to the duration of each exam and other adjustments necessary to ensure fairness
in the assessment conditions [Details in Chapter B]. The contact points dedicated to different
specific situations strengthen support for students (psychological assistance, health, etc.).
This proactive approach is a testament to ISI's commitment to creating an inclusive environment where
every student feels supported and understood.
As for international students, ISI welcomes them and offers them a service
academic in the same way as Tunisian students and this according to the legal texts (Annex F.2),
thus promoting a welcoming environment conducive to the development and integration of
international students within the establishment
F.2 Student life
The ISI's societal commitment considers that student life, particularly in its dimensions
associative, civic, sporting and cultural activities are a fundamental element for the achievement of
its training objectives. Its geographical position in the center of Ariana represents an asset
strategic given the amenities and facilities available such as: public transport, hospital
Ariana, the El-Menzah sports complex and the availability of fast food nearby.
The ISI provides students with several facilities ranging from dedicated and equipped spaces to
funding as part of improving student life. These initiatives find a
balance between associative commitment and their classic academic courses. The ISI ensures that all of its
students an environment conducive to learning, providing them with spaces for
revision where they can devote themselves to their studies in favorable conditions and at their disposal
infrastructure for organizing training and workshops.
Regarding student health, ISI provides a comprehensive health service including:
a nurse and a psychologist, in order to provide psychological support. The institute is committed
actively creating an environment where the needs of each student, whether they are
academic, physical or emotional, are taken into account to promote their overall success.
The ISI infrastructure is composed of three distinct blocks (A, B and C), thus establishing a framework
conducive and friendly for students in their academic activities such as
- Student living spaces used for the organization of sports activities (Annex F.3);
- Recently fitted out club premises (Annex F.4);
- Refreshment bar in the institute responding to student demand (following a survey) (Appendix

Activities: ISI offers its students sports and cultural activities such as table tennis,
Badminton, boys' football (Ariana field), chess, etc. The institute organizes
also every year days (such as “ISI Entertainment Day”, “ISI Got Talent”, “ISI
TRADITION", etc.) dedicated to sporting and cultural activities which are the objective of several
competitions (Annexes F.11 F.12 and F.13).
 
An event organizing committee “ISI EVENTS” was created to promote collaboration and
coordination between the different student entities, thus allowing planning and
efficient execution of events and initiatives thus creating good synergy.
 
The ISI strongly encourages the creation of student clubs, governed by internal regulations adopted and
respected by all members. The institute also includes several associations and subsidiaries
of national and international associations.
Clubs: ISI has several clubs namely, Securinets, ARTBOX, Freeways, IEEE_ISI, Codex_JE,

This is reflected in several initiatives, such as
- monitoring the evolution of the job market: Thanks to the internship management, the quality unit and the
center 4C (see Figure G-1), the ISI remains informed of the main data linked to the evolution of the market
of the employment of engineers in Tunisia. This approach involves monitoring statistics and
official reports, in particular those of the National Observatory of Employment and Qualifications
(ONEQ) available at the following address: http://www.emploi.gov.tn/fr/160/presentation-oneq, from
the National Agency for Employment and Independent Work (ANETI) can be consulted on  
https://www.emploi.nat.tn/https://www.emploi.nat.tn/, as well as the National Institute of
Statistics (INS) available at https://www.ins.tn/statistiques/93.
 
In parallel with these periodic analysis efforts, the ISI also conducts a prospective analysis at
short term employment market trend through employability surveys
of its graduates (Appendix G.1).

In this context, the ISI is the first Tunisian establishment to join the new
IBM Global University global program launched in 2020. More than 200 students, mainly
engineering students, obtained their certifications in 2022/2023 via the academies (Cisco,
Huawei, IBM), following training provided by teachers certified as instructors by
these same academies (see Table G-3).
- ongoing dialogue with the industrial fabric is maintained in order to identify new
professional opportunities through various initiatives throughout the training cycle
such as partnership, sharing of internship and job offers, forums, workshops,
training provided by experts, round tables always involving students,
teachers, and businesses.
 
G.2 Insertion results
The integration of young ISI graduates is regularly monitored through surveys carried out
by the internship management. The results of these surveys highlight several
performance indicators namely a very low unemployment rate, high salaries per
compared to the national average, the adequacy of the positions occupied by alumni to the programs of
training courses offered to inspire future reforms. The institute communicates to its students and
its graduates the results of these surveys. As an example, the data from this present survey
(Appendix G.5) were collected between April 19, 2022 and December 4, 2023, targeting graduates of
ISI for the last 5 years. A total of 173 graduates participated in the survey.
 
Characteristics of the graduates surveyed
 
In line with the recent UNESCO report which confirms that Tunisia occupies second place
world leader in terms of high number of women engineers per capita
(https://lapresse.tn/101258/femmes-ingenieurs-la-tunisie-classee-deuxieme-dans-le-
world/#:~:text=Tunisia is the second, the opportunity of a), the
The rate of female engineering students at the ISI is slightly higher (52%) than that of
male students;
  
Professional situation of graduates
According to the results of the same survey, it seems indisputable that the disciplines provided by
ISI are in high demand on the job market. Indeed, the average rate of integration
professional for the IDL, IDISC and ISEOC engineering courses is 90% (see Figure G-3).

Access to employment
ISI engineers easily access the job market after obtaining their
degrees. In fact, on average 70% of students in each course obtain their first
employment within the first six months after graduation. About 50% are even
hired in less than two months. In addition, nearly 20% of students received a promise
hiring before the end of their PFE.  
Nature of the first employment contract  
According to the survey results, the average percentage of graduates working under a permanent contract
The indefinite contract (CDI) is 58%, while that under a fixed-term contract (CDD) is 7%.
Sector of activity  
According to the results of the same survey, we find that the ICT and
Telecommunications are predominant for graduates from the three sectors.  
Profile of first position held
On average 70%, which represents the majority of the sample, occupy a position in line with
their training. This includes positions such as development engineer, BI consultant and AI engineer
for graduates from IDL training, network/telecom engineers, IT audit and consultant in
IT security for IDISC graduates and engineers
from ISEOC training, the first positions are often obtained in embedded systems and
development.
Career monitoring/Professional training after hiring
The ISI remains attentive to the professional development of its graduates and their skills development.
According to the survey results, 70% of the graduates surveyed did not receive any training
additional training following their hiring. This demonstrates the quality of the training provided
by the ISI and the adequacy of the skills instilled with the requirements of the job market (see
Figure G-5).
Geographic distribution of first job
A relatively high average rate of 15.8% of graduates are in employment
professionals abroad.  
  
Net Annual Salaries, Without Bonus  
According to the survey results, the majority of ISI engineers receive a first annual salary
between 12000 and 24000 DT (see Figure G-6).  
Gross Annual Salaries, Without Bonus
ISI graduates employed abroad reported receiving gross annual salaries exceeding
20,000 euros. On average, more than 50% of the survey participants have a salary of more than 40,000
euros annually without including bonuses.

Business creation  
According to the survey results, 7.5% of diplomas in all specialties combined have
claimed to have founded a startup after graduation.
G.3 Professional life of graduates
Engineers graduating from ISI are now fully integrated into the socio-economic fabric.
Recognizing their inestimable value to their institution, ISI has recently initiated an active dialogue
with his former students asking them to share their experiences and recommendations
via survey forms. The main objective is to collect feedback on their journey
academics at ISI and their expectations for quality training. Through this survey, ISI
aims to obtain information on employability rates and other performance indicators
relevant.
The institute encourages interactions between current students and alumni through various
initiatives, including inviting ISI graduates to participate in round tables and various
events organized by the ISI (See chapter C). Engineering students thus benefit from feedback
experience and success stories of Alumni, the solicitation of ISI graduates as
as an expert teacher. A percentage of 5.8% of the sample targeted by the survey have already participated
as a trainer at ISI after graduation, the participation of ISI graduates
to the monitoring of PFE of engineering students. Indeed, a total of 31% of the sample declared having
participated as professional supervisors in the supervision of PFE (see Figure G-4). This
involvement demonstrates that the training and profiles of ISI engineers arouse the interest of
companies thanks to the performance of ISI graduates already hired as employees.
This undoubtedly demonstrates the strong sense of belonging of engineering students towards the ISI.
ISI actively supports the existence of an alumni association. Approximately 70% of graduates have
expressed their willingness to participate in the ISI Young Graduates Association, thereby strengthening the
sense of belonging of the students. With this in mind, in 2021, the institute launched a group
ISI Alumni Facebook with over 400 members, fostering connection between former graduates,
current students and teachers. Group members have taken various initiatives, such as
inviting ISI graduate clubs to events focused on their areas of expertise,
as well as the dissemination of internship and job offers, thus highlighting the importance of this space
communication.
