Practical activities (Projects, internships, dissertations, etc.)
Practical activities related to the use of support and tools for the design and evaluation of
HMI as well as business process modeling. In addition, a mini-project with the objective of
implementation of acquired knowledge is associated with this unit.
4- Content (course descriptions and plans)  
Teaching: see the detailed module sheets for each ECUE
This Teaching Unit allows learners to develop their skills in the
context of developments relating to the design of HMIs and business workflows.  
 
 
Practical EU activities  
Practical activities related to the use of support and tools for object processing
multimedia, especially image and video media.
 
5- Teaching methods and teaching resources specific to the EU (methods and tools
educational materials, reference works, use of ICT/distance learning possibilities, etc.)
 
1- Detailed course support for each chapter of the course
2- Bibliographic references (books, web links) must be provided to learners
3- Tools appropriate to the content of each module will be installed, configured and
used during practical activity sessions.
                  5- Exams and assessment of knowledge
Assessment methods and examination system (Present the recommended assessment system: control
continuous only or, mixed regime i.e. continuous assessment and final exams)
 
1- Mixed diet:  
All the ECUEs of this UE are under mixed regime: control + Final exam  
Continuous assessment: Graded work/assessments
This work aims to verify the acquisition of knowledge and the skills to apply and
transfer the concepts studied to concrete situations.  
The final proctored exam covers all course material and will consist of questions
objectives, development, case studies, problems, etc.
