Teaching Unit: Connected Objects
ECUE no 1.1: Communication protocols for connected objects
Constituent Element Plan (ECUE)
Prerequisites:
 
1- Advanced microcontroller architecture
2- Sensor and actuator
 
 
Constituent Element Learning Objectives (CELU):
 
At the end of the component, the student will be able to:
OE1: Build the complete chain enabling the design of a connected object as well as
understanding each element of this chain.
OE2: highlight the nodes (sensors, actuators, microcontrollers)
OE3: Define IoT communication protocols (MQTT, HTTP, CoAP,…)
OE4: Define gateways, servers and Brokers, terminal (application: web, mobile, desktop)
