ISI Strategic Orientation Plan 
2024-2027 
 
Introduction 
Strategic planning is a necessary step for any organization to 
Achieve a clear medium- and long-term vision. Its aim is to set the strategic choices in 
aligned with the institution's mission, vision and values. 
It is in this context that the ISI's Strategic Orientation Plan (SOP) was developed for the 
period 2024-2027. It was validated by its scientific council on 14/12/2023. 
The development of this strategic plan followed a clear methodology that began with analysis 
the context of the institute through: 
- Definition of the mission, vision and values of the ISI. 
- External diagnosis carried out as part of the implementation of the ISO 21001:2018 system. 
- Internal diagnosis, through feedback from the various stakeholders: 
Surveys of students, teachers, administrators, graduates and companies 
Partners 
This diagnosis made it possible to identify all the internal and external factors that influence the ISI. 
It understands strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities and threats 
her. 
By identifying the opportunities and challenges facing the ISI, the SOP aspires to define a 
roadmap for the next four years to enable the ISI to become a centre of excellence

not only in the transmission of knowledge, but also in the training of individuals 
competent, innovative and socially responsible. 
Identification of the strategic context of the ISI: 
Identifying the strategic context is an essential step in developing a plan 
strategic direction. Indeed, the strategic plan must be aligned with the strategic context of the 
establishment to be effective. This step begins with the definition of the mission, the vision 
and the values of the ISI: 
 
Mission 
The ISI has three main missions: 
- Diploma training (Bachelor's, Master's and engineers) in the field of computer science 
and its applications 
- Scientific research and innovation 
- Continuous training and openness to the professional environment 
 
Vision: 
ISI's vision is to be a recognized leader in higher education in computer science, 
programs of excellence and training professionals who are at the forefront of 
technological advances. The ISI aspires to be a hub for innovation, research and the transfer of 
knowledge, thus contributing to the advancement of society and digital transformation.

The challenges 
An in-depth analysis of the SWOT matrix helps to identify the challenges that the ISI needs to address 
face. Indeed, the excellent reputation of the institute is confirmed year after year in view of the 
post-baccalaureate orientation scores, which places the ISI among the three most sought-after institutions in 
the national level and the institution most in demand for the specific entrance examination to the 
engineering training. The ISI also has significant strengths that allow it to 
position itself as a major player in higher education in the digital field.  
However, it has to deal with certain weaknesses, in particular the working environment. The ISI 
also faces challenges, including increased competition from other institutions,
