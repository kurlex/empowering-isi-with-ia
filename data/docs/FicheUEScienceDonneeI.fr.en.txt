                  5- Exams and assessment of knowledge
Assessment methods and examination system (Present the recommended assessment system: control
continuous only or, mixed regime i.e. continuous assessment and final exams)
 
1- Mixed diet:  
All the ECUEs of this UE are under mixed regime: control + Final exam  
Continuous assessment: Graded work/assessments
This work aims to verify the acquisition of knowledge and the skills to apply and
transfer the concepts studied to concrete situations.  
The final proctored exam covers all course material and will consist of questions
objectives, development, case studies, problems, etc.

Mathematics
 
 
Constituent Element Learning Objectives (CELU):
At the end of this course students will be able to:
-
OE1: Develop the elements introduced in the basic probability courses and
statistics in a multivariate framework; the aim being to provide the tools allowing
to analyze multidimensional data sets.  
-
OE2: At the end of the course, the student should be able to implement, with
real data, the most classic processing tools. The course will therefore focus on
good understanding of methods and their application, including mastery
of appropriate software.
