Teaching Unit: Connected Objects
ECUE no 1.1: Smart sensors and sensor networks
Constituent Element Plan (ECUE)
Prerequisites:
 
1- Signals and systems
2- Basic notions about sensors
3- Basic notions of networks
 
 
Constituent Element Learning Objectives (CELU):
 
At the end of the component, the student will be able to:
OE1: Define smart sensors and specify the difference between classic sensors
and intelligent.  
OE2: Highlighting the hardware architecture of a wireless smart sensor as well as the
architecture of sensor networks, their technical characteristics, their specificities and
their classification.  
OE3: Study the problems of this type of network.
OE4: Define certain applications of RCSFs.
