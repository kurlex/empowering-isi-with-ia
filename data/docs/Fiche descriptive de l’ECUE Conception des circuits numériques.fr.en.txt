FPGA
ECUE no 1.1: Design of digital circuits  
Constituent Element Plan (ECUE)
Prerequisites:
 
1- Advanced processor architecture
2- Logical system
 
Learning objectives of the constituent element (ECUE):
 
OE1- Model, from a specification, a complex digital circuit and
synthesizable with a hardware description language and to validate it functionally.
OE2- Evaluate the performance of these circuits and understand the steps required for its
implementation on a programmable FPGA circuit.
OE3- Understanding analog and digital electronic systems and components
 
Association matrix between the objectives of the constituent element and those of the
training program (OP)
